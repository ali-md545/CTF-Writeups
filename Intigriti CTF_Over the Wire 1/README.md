Challenge: Over the Wire (Part 1)
I'm not sure how secure this protocol is but as long as we update the password, I'm sure everything will be fine ðŸ˜Š

We were given a pcap file. I started analyzing it using Wireshark. Firstly, I tried to filter out the TCP packets and followed TCP stream. At tcp.stream eq 8 I found an FTP connection and data was being transferred.

2 things to notice here:
â€¢	A password for user â€˜catâ€™ which is looking like an FTP password (as the protocol also suggests).
â€¢	A flag.zip file which is being transferred.

So, after seeing the flag.zip file I immediately checked if I can extract the file from PCAP (using Exports Objects in Wireshark) but that didnâ€™t pay off. So I dug further in TCP stream.

It seems like a result of an 'ls -l' command. At this point, I was only concerned about extracting the flag.zip file from this PCAP. I used CHATGPT to look for some linux tools for this purpose and I came across this tool called â€˜Foremostâ€™. 
Foremost is typically used for file carving and data recovery from disk images rather than pcap files. However, you can still try to use Foremost to extract files from a pcap file, but the success might vary depending on the nature of the traffic. 
Using the following command I was able to extract the zip file from PCAP:
foremost -i your_file.pcap -o output_directory
â€¢	-i your_file.pcap: Specifies the input pcap file.
â€¢ -o output_directory: Specifies the output directory where Foremost should save the recovered files.

The 'flag.txt' file was password protected, so I used the password I found earlier in Wireshark â€˜5up3r_53cur3_p455w0rd_2022â€™ but it was wrong. So I went to Wireshark again and further analyzed the TCP stream.

I got this packet with an interesting bit of information. As it says, â€˜update it accordinglyâ€™ and also in challenge information it said 'update the password', so I changed the password from 2022 to 2023 and voila, I opened the file and got the flag.
